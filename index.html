1.1 GENERAL STATEMENTS
1.1.1 General principles
The General Notices apply to all texts of the European Pharmacopoeia.

The texts of the European Pharmacopoeia are published in English and French. Translations in other languages may be prepared by the signatory States of the European Pharmacopoeia Convention. In case of doubt or dispute, the English and French versions published by the EDQM are alone authoritative.

The date on which texts of the European Pharmacopoeia are to be implemented is fixed by a resolution of the European Committee on Pharmaceuticals and Pharmaceutical Care (Partial Agreement) of the Council of Europe, following a recommendation by the Ph. Eur. Commission. This date is usually 1 year after adoption and about 6 months after publication. Where a text needs to be implemented at a date earlier than the next publication date of a new edition or supplement of the European Pharmacopoeia, a resolution of the European Committee on Pharmaceuticals and Pharmaceutical Care is issued, giving the full text to be implemented. The text is also published in Pharmeuropa Online for information and posted on the EDQM website as part of the resolution.

In the texts of the European Pharmacopoeia, the word ‘Pharmacopoeia’ without qualification means the European Pharmacopoeia. The official abbreviation ‘Ph. Eur.’ may also be used for this purpose.

1.1.1.1 Quality systems
The quality standards represented by monographs are valid only where the articles in question are produced within the framework of a suitable quality system. The quality system must assure that the articles consistently meet the requirements of the Ph. Eur.

1.1.1.2 Conventional terms
Medicinal product. (a) Any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings and/or animals; or (b) any substance or combination of substances that may be used in or administered to human beings and/or animals with a view either to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis.

Active substance. Any substance intended to be used in the manufacture of a medicinal product and that, when so used, becomes an active ingredient of the medicinal product. Such substances are intended to have a pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure and function of the body.

Excipient (auxiliary substance). Any constituent of a medicinal product that is not an active substance. Adjuvants, stabilisers, antimicrobial preservatives, diluents and antioxidants are examples of excipients.

Herbal medicinal product. Any medicinal product exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal drugs or one or more herbal drug preparations, or one or more such herbal drugs in combination with one or more such herbal drug preparations.

Competent authority. The national, supranational or international body or organisation vested with the authority for making decisions concerning the issue in question. It may, for example, be a national pharmacopoeia authority (NPA), a licensing authority or an official medicines control laboratory (OMCL).

‘Unless otherwise justified and authorised’. This expression means that the requirements must be met, unless the competent authority authorises a modification (e.g. of an analytical procedure or limit) or an exemption, if justified by the manufacturer in a particular case.

‘Should’. Statements containing the word ‘should’ are informative or advisory.

‘Suitable’, ‘appropriate’. In certain texts, the terms ‘suitable’ and ‘appropriate’ are used to describe a reagent, test, micro-organism, etc.; in such cases, if criteria for suitability are not described in the text, suitability is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authority.

1.1.1.3 References to regulatory documents
Monographs and general chapters may contain references to documents issued by regulatory authorities for medicines, for example directives and notes for guidance of the European Union. These references are provided to users of the Ph. Eur. for information. Inclusion of such a reference does not modify the status of the documents referred to, unless explicitly stated in the text.</textarea>
